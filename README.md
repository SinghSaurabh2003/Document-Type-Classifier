# 🏗️ Development Journey

## Version 1.1

### Objective

Develop an initial transfer learning model for document classification.

### Pipeline

- Dataset preprocessing
- Transfer Learning using ResNet18
- only using Fully Connected layer(last layer of resnet)
- Evaluation pipeline
- No. of epochs=10
- best model and last model saved using checkpointing.

### Limitation

During evaluation, the model produced:

- Validation Accuracy : **77%**
- Test Accuracy : **less then 70%**

---

## Version 1.2

### Objective

Develop an transfer learning model for document classification.

### Pipeline

- Dataset preprocessing
- Transfer Learning using ResNet18
- Layer4 fine-tuning
- Evaluation pipeline
- No. of epochs=10-25
- best model and last model saved using checkpointing.

### Limitation

During evaluation, the model produced:

- Validation Accuracy : **91.83%**
- Test Accuracy : **81.39%**

The Memo class achieved **0% accuracy**.

Investigation revealed that the training dataset contained only **6 Memo images**, while the test dataset contained approximately **2,500 Memo images**, resulting in severe class imbalance.

---

## Version 2

### Improvements

The complete training dataset was verified and corrected using a python script.

The missing Memo class images were restored, resulting in a balanced dataset containing approximately **20,000 images per class**.

The model was resumed from the best checkpoint and fine-tuned further without retraining from scratch.

- No. of epochs=25-35
  
- best model and last model saved using checkpointing.

During evaluation, the model produced:

- Validation Accuracy : **95.98%**
- Test Accuracy : **89.66%**

### Final Results

| Metric | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Accuracy | **89.66%** |
| Precision | **89.68%** |
| Recall | **89.66%** |
| F1 Score | **89.65%** |

Memo class accuracy improved from:

```
0%
```

to

```
83.87%
```

# 📊 Final Performance

| Class | Accuracy |
|---------|----------|
| Advertisement | 93.24% |
| Budget | 88.86% |
| Email | 97.22% |
| File Folder | 97.35% |
| Form | 80.57% |
| Handwritten | 94.63% |
| Invoice | 85.75% |
| Letter | 85.19% |
| Memo | 83.87% |

Overall Test Accuracy:

**89.66%**

# 🌐 Streamlit Application

The application allows users to:

- Upload document images
- Predict document category
- Display confidence score
- View Top-3 predictions
- Perform real-time inference

---

# 📈 Evaluation

The evaluation pipeline automatically generates:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
- Per-class Accuracy
- Prediction CSV

---

# ⚠️ Current Limitations

- Supports only nine document categories.
- Relies solely on visual document appearance; textual content is not analyzed.
- Performance may decrease on heavily distorted, low-resolution, or handwritten documents outside the training distribution.
- Single-label classification only.
- ResNet18 provides a good balance between speed and accuracy but is not the most powerful backbone available.

---

# 🔮 Future Scope

Future improvements include:

- Support for all 16 RVL-CDIP document categories(Current pipeline support training of any number of classes just dataset and "NUM_CLASSES" needs to be changed).
- Adoption of stronger vision backbones such as EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, or Vision Transformers (ViT).
- Integration of OCR for combining visual and textual information.
- Multi-page document classification.
- Explainable AI using Grad-CAM to visualize model attention.
- Active learning to continuously improve performance with user feedback.
- REST API deployment using FastAPI.
- Docker containerization for scalable deployment.
- Cloud deployment with automated CI/CD.
- Support for multilingual document classification.
